# OpenChannelCalculator
This is a project whithin the class of programming of NTUA's School of Civil Engineering which I took and calculates hydraulic properties of open channels.

Description:
The programm is written exclusively in pyhton as it was the main subject of the class.
The programm is equipped with an easy to use GUI.
It uses Mannings formula to calculate the hydraulic properties like water velocity
and discharge and also has a "depth mode" that calcualtes the depth of the flow using
a the bisection numerical method.


How to Use:
Download the source code and run the "mainwindow.py".
You need to have python installed 
No other library is needed.



There is also a presentation about how the program works but unfortunally is in Greek.
